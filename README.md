# Analysis of Weather with Kolmogorov Complexity
## Abstract
Traditional complexity measures are seldom applied to time series data, particularly in meteorology. This study explores the applicability of Kolmogorov Complexity as an analytical tool for evaluating weather data. By approximating complexity through GZIP compression, we assess the complexity of weather patterns and investigate potential correlations with seasonality and Hurricanes.

## Problem
Traditional methods for analyzing meteorological time series data often rely on statistical and dynamical models, which may not fully capture the underlying complexity of weather patterns. Despite the presence of chaotic and nonlinear dynamics in meteorological systems, complexity measures such as Kolmogorov Complexity remain underutilized in this domain. The challenge lies in determining whether Kolmogorov Complexity, when approximated through compression techniques, can provide meaningful insights into weather data. Specifically, can this measure help quantify the complexity of atmospheric patterns and reveal correlations with extreme weather events, such as hurricanes? Addressing this problem could lead to new perspectives on weather prediction and the characterization of extreme events.
